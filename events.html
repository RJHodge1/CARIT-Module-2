			personel with members of the community. We highly encourage anyone interested in meeting our staff to drop by and say hello. You may even learn a thing or two.

					to help out their communities. Our staff participates in cleaning up beaches, restoring natural parks, and delivering heart warming lessons to the growing minds
					of our future leaders. If anyone is interested in participating, we know the students of today would appreciate a little giving back from their forerunners.</p>

					<p class="eventInfoTable">The first week of every month, we host free seminars for students and community members alike to help them understand the cutting
					edge of the technological landscape. Former speakers have included Patrick Rothfuss, PhD, Linus Torvalds' cousin, and Bill Watergate. This month, our lesson
					will be on personal data and the encroaching future of monitized monitoring. We hope to see you there!</p>
