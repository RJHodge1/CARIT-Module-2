			About Our Center
		</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to the Center for Applied Research in Information Technology. We are a center dedicated to bring the brightest minds in research and technology
			together with the business leaders in our local community. We are an interdisciplinary research group that provides high quality technical assessment to
			bring companies into the 21st century. Here, we believe that technology is without equal when it comes to the modern workplace, and we would like to 
			help you get up to speed and ahead of your competitors in data sciences, analytical research, mobile development, and web presence.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is our hope that you will be able to utilize the resources we provide to better understand how technology and business interact with one another in an
			increasingly important way. You can find information about our organization, faculty, and upcoming events on the side panel. We hope to hear from you soon!
